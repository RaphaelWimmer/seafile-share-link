# README #

First a script to create share-links from the command line.

Later a GUI-wrapper to be used from nautilus.

Version 0 :-)

### How do I get set up? ###

* copy `seafile-share-link` into your PATH (`~/bin` or maybe `/usr/local/bin`)
* you will need to have `sqlite3` command-line utility installed.
